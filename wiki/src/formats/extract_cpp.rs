/// Every capture shape a definition's name can take. The general `(_)` form
/// must NOT be used where a qualified-name pattern can also match:
/// tree-sitter emits one match per pattern with no specificity resolution, so
/// a general pattern alongside the qualified-name patterns below would yield
/// two entries for one definition — one with the owner spliced into an
/// already-qualified name — and `dedup_by` would not collapse them, because
/// their signatures differ.
///
/// The six wrapper patterns are the exception, and are general on purpose. They
/// require the `declarator:` field to be a `pointer_declarator` or a
/// `reference_declarator`, where every other pattern requires a bare
/// `function_declarator`, so no node can be matched by both and there is
/// nothing to disambiguate. Spelling out the alternation there instead would
/// need a qualified twin for each, twelve patterns for the same result, and
/// would drop `Level* OrderBook::top()` on the floor in the meantime. The
/// safety of `(_)` rests on `qualified_owner` reaching no owner THROUGH a
/// wrapper — an owner resolved there would be spliced ahead of the qualifier
/// the source already wrote. `a_pointer_returning_out_of_line_definition_renders_its_owner_once`
/// pins that pairing.
///
/// `function_definition` alone covers only members with a BODY, so a
/// declaration-only header would carry nothing but `class OrderBook`;
/// `field_declaration` and `declaration` are what reach the rest, and are also
/// what admit constructors (an `identifier` declarator, because the grammar
/// cannot know the name is the class's), destructors and operators.
///
/// Types and functions are indexed; DATA is not — no member variables, no
/// file-scope globals or constants. The one exception is the `@item` pattern
/// at the end: a namespace- or file-scope variable is an item (kind `value`),
/// never an export. `field_declaration.declarator` is
/// `multiple`, so `int a, b, c;` emits three matches over one node, and
/// `default_cut` finds no `body` field. An item's signature is then the
/// declaration's specifiers plus that declarator's own text (`int a`, `int *b`,
/// `int f()`, `int *g()`; see `shared_declaration_signature`), while the
/// `## Exports` line still renders the whole declaration with the owner spliced
/// in. A struct's layout stays visible in the page's `## Body`, which renders
/// the source verbatim.
///
/// `Entity::methods` shares the node too: `extract_code`'s `is_function` check
/// reads `def.child_by_field_name("declarator")`, which, because that field is
/// `multiple`, always returns the FIRST declarator on the shared node. For
/// `int *g(), f();` that is a wrapper around a `function_declarator`, so both
/// matches classify as functions and both reach `methods`, which is the right
/// answer. It stays a latent mis-read (a declaration mixing a function and a
/// data declarator would classify both alike), pre-existing and rare:
/// documented, not fixed.
///
/// KNOWINGLY UNCOVERED, each observed against the real grammar:
///   * declarator nesting beyond ONE wrapper — the six wrapper patterns reach
///     exactly one deep, and `int** f()` is
///     `(pointer_declarator (pointer_declarator (function_declarator …)))`;
///   * qualifier nesting beyond two — `a::b::C::m` needs a third pattern;
///   * an out-of-line nested class (`class Outer::Inner { … }`), whose
///     `class_specifier` names itself with a `qualified_identifier`, not the
///     `type_identifier` these patterns require;
///   * template specializations, whose head is a `template_declaration`
///     wrapping a `class_specifier` named by a `template_type`;
///   * a pointer- or reference-returning OUT-OF-LINE definition
///     (`Level* OrderBook::top() { … }`) classifies as `FreeDef`, not
///     `Member`: `qualified_owner` resolves `None` through the wrapper (see
///     its own doc), so `classify` sees no owner and sorts the definition
///     away from its class in `## Exports`, where it also competes in
///     `pick_summary_fallback` against genuine free functions. Closing this
///     needs `qualified_owner` to descend a wrapper level AND the wrapper
///     patterns' `(_)` capture narrowed in the same change — out of scope
///     here;
///   * a conversion operator (`operator bool()`) parses as an `operator_cast`
///     declarator under an `abstract_function_declarator`, not an
///     `operator_name` under a `function_declarator`, so no pattern here
///     reaches it;
///   * a file-scope most-vexing parse (`Level* p(q);` at namespace scope)
///     matches the pointer-declarator wrapper pattern and is exported as a
///     function: `cpp_placement`'s rejection only fires inside a
///     `compound_statement`, which a namespace or file scope is not.
